Today, I started work with Typing Club and made some progress. After Typing Club, I continue adding to my website. This time I added a search menu to my website and added functional links for the menu to work. I added the input on the main html page, and added the styling and functioning to style.css and script.js. I than created a pull request for Kajari to look over and leave moment on the changes to commit on the coding.
