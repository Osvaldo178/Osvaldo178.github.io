Today, I began the workday with Typing Club for an hour, and then transferred to adding more pages to my website. I added to new html pages: `clashes_between_ideas.html` and `philosophical_issues.html`. Clashes Between Idas is the section where there is critique of both Communism and Capitalism, and how they both can be issues to society depending how its practiced. Philosophical Issues is a more in depth view on capitalism, and covering the misconception of socialism and communism being the same idea. I added images related to the topics in there respected section, and gave an economic apporach of which system is better at working out. I than created a pull request for Kajari to have an overvie of my work and leave comments to resolve and commit changes on my website.
