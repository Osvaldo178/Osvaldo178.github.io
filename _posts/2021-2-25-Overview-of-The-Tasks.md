Today, we started off with typing club as usual and sent our daily progress to Kajari. Kajari than instructed us to work on a task on how to set up a barrier to prevent the player from going off bounds in the Catch Monster practice. We had trouble at first on how to complete the task and we used multiple websites until we realized the coding was in the practice. With Kajari's help, we were able to understand what code to add and change up for the barrier to function. 
Hero X must always be above 0 and below the width (512), as negatives don't exist in the real world. Same applies with Hero Y, as it must be always above 0 and below the height (480).  The player must not past the width nor the height, as we're trying to prevent the player from going off boundaries. After a few more issues and adjustments, we were able to accomplish the task, later sending Kajari a pull request to review it.
