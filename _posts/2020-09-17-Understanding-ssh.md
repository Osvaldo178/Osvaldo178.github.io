An SSH key is an authentication protocol that allows users to modify/control servers remotely through web services and a personal computer. SSH functions as an authentication system for remote users, allowing the transfer of inputs from the client to the host, leading the output back to the client. SSH has two keys for the system to work. A private key, used by the user to decrypt information from the SSH protocol, while remaining private. A public key is used to encrypt information by both the user and server.
