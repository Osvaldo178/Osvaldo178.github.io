Today, Kajari instructed Celeste and I to work on Html practice. [This is the website we used](https://www.learn-html.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21) The task was for us to get practice on the coding we'll be using for web design and to take notes on the most important sections. 

* Hello, World! - The exercise focused on introducing the user to the `<title>` and `<p>` codes. To enable the `<title>` in the code, the user must write the code in the `<head>` section and must be written as followed: `<title>`Example`</title>`. To write any body paragraph or sentence, the user must write the code in the `<body>` section and must be written as followed: `<p>`Insert Example here`</p>`. the `</>` in codes are used as ending to the coding sequence and that the code full plugs in.
* Basic Elements - The excecise focused on introducing the user to Text headers and paragraphs. Tags are written within the `<body>` part. The basic elements of an HTML page are the following:
	* Text Headers - `<h1>`-`<h6>` tags are used to create the header of a paragraph or sentence.
	* Paragraph - `<p>` tag is used to allow a paragraph/sentence to be written after it is denoted.
	* Horizontal Ruler - another name for `<hr/>` to allow seperation between two page sections.
	* Link - `<a>` allows a link to be written.
	* List - `<ul>` allows an unordered list, `<ol>` allows an ordered list, and `<li>` allows the user to list elements.
	* Image - `<img>` enables image coding.
	* Divider - `<div>` enables the code.
	* Text Span - `<span>` enables the code.
* Images - The exercise focused on introducing the user on how to add an image code using Html. `<src>` is used to specify an image's location. 
	* Adding an image - `<img src="/static/img/code.jpg">`
	* Sizing the image - `<img src="/static/img/code.jpg" width="100">` to `<img src="/static/img/code.jpg" style="width: 100px">`.
	* Lossless Formats - (PNG) Useful for pixel perfect graphics such as logos.
	* Lossy Formats - (JPG) Useful for displaying rich images.
	* Animated Formats - (GIF) Useful for showing short animated images.
