Today, Kajari instructed Celeste and I to work on Html practice. [This is the website we used](https://www.learn-html.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21) The task was for us to get practice on the coding we'll be using for web design and to take notes on the most important sections. 

* Hello, World! - The excercise focused on introducing the user to the `<title>` and `<p>` codes. To enable the `<title>` in the code, the user must write the code in the `<head>` section and must be written as followed: <title>Example</title>. To write any body paragraph or sentence, the user must write the code in the <body> section and must be written as followed: <p>Insert Example here</p>. the </> in codes are used as ending to the coding sequence and that the code full plugs in.
* Basic Elements - The excecise focused on introducing the user to Text headers and paragraphs. Tags are written within the <body> part. The basic elements of an HTML page are the following:
	* Text Headers - <h1>-<h6> tags are used to create the header of a paragraph or sentence.
	* Paragraph - <p> tag is used to allow a paragraph/sentence to be written after it is denoted.
	* Horizontal Ruler - another name for <hr/> to allow seperation between two page sections.
	* Link - <a> allows a link to be written.
	* List - <ul> allows an unordered list, <ol> allows an ordered list, and <li> allows the user to list elements.
	* Image - <img> enables image coding.
	* Divider - <div> enables the code.
	* Text Span - <span> enables the code.
* Images
