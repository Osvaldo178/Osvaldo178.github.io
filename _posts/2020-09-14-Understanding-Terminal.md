  Terminal is an OS application used to create simple command bases and pave the basis of complex programming skills. The terminal is a way to interact with the computer without the mouse and without any graphical user interface. My understandment of terminal is that it is a simpler way to command and quite efficient in typing complex commands. Kajari taught both Celeste and I of the application, as we were going to be using the application to set up github through the computer instead of a link. Kajari taught us five commands needed to continue setting up Github through the terminal: 
- ls- The ‘ls’ command allows you to access the home directory. 
- cd- The ‘cd’ command allows you to change the directory. 
- pwd- The ‘pwd’ command allows you to print the working directory. 
- mkdir- The ‘mkdir’ command allows you to make a new folder in the terminal. 
- md- The ‘md’ command allows the user to make a directory in a specific path.
