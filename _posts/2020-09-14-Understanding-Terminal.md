  Terminal is an OS application used to create simple command bases and pave the basis of complex programming skills. My understandment of terminal is that it is a simpler way to command and quite efficient in typing complex commands. Kajari taught both Celeste and I of the application, as we were going to be using the application to set up github through the computer instead of a link. Kajari taught us five commands needed to continue setting up Github through the terminal. The ‘ls’ command allows you to access the home directory. The ‘cd’ command allows you to change the directory. The ‘pwd’ command allows you to print the working directory. The ‘mkdir’ command allows you to make a new folder in the terminal. The ‘md’ command allows the user to make a directory in a specific path.
