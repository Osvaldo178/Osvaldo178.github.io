Today, Kajari instructed Celeste and I to design and sketch our website that we're planning on creating using our knowledge of Html, CSS, and Javascript. I sketched my website to focus on Philosophy and Ideologies (Socialism and Capitalism), and explaining the overall concept is based on and its implementation in the real world. For ideologies, I focus on describing the pros/cons, political influence, systematic practice, and connections between Socialism and Capitalism being controversial topics. For Philosophy, I plan on explaining the overall concept of controversial philosophical thinking, implementation in the real world, and how the philosophical concept is explained and its perception in thinking. Ideologies would be based upon in the Con/Diff section, while Philosophy would be based in the Homepage and Search bar section. Homepage would also have an image of a famous philospher with a quote explaining what philosophy is. All websites used for research would have there links in the bottom section of the page for viewers to refer to. Here are the images of my website design: ![webpage_image_1](images/assets/image1.jpg) ![webpage_image_1](images/assets/image2.jpg)
