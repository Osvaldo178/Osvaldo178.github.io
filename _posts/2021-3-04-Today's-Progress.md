Today was a short day, as Kajari is giving us the afternoon off to have more time to study for our last finals. We began the day with practicing for 30 minutes on Typing Club, and than sent Kajari the progress for today. After, we met with Kajari in a meeting to discuss about making an accurate barrier for the player to avoid leaving off boundaries. She explained to us a more accurate approach on where the hero is positioned, and if we alter the hero's width, height, and position, the hero will be positioned in different parts of the canvas. After the explanation, Kajari gave us a code to write for the right and bottom barriers to fully work. We needed to add a player width and height, as we only originally had a height and width for the canvas, but needed the hero's as well. Once we completed that, we make sure the change worked, and after sent a pull request to Kajari for her approvel.
