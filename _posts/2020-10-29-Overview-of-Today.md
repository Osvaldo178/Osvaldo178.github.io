Today, Kajari instrcuted Celeste and I to continue working on the Html practice needed for designing our website. I managed to complete the sections of Styles, Classes, Selectors, and UI Libraries while typing down notes for these sections. I undestood what CSS is and the use of these elements needed for our web design project. I also was able to work on my typing speed and accuracy early in the morning right before wroking on the Html practice.
