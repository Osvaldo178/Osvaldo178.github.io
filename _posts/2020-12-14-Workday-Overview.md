Today, We began work with completing an hour of Typing Club and sent Kajari the stats for today's Typing Club task. After completing our first task, we continued working on our website, and I was able to add more text to the paragraphs and align the title of the website. I added into the paragrahs a more detailed explanation and cut some parts off that were irrelevant to the website in general. I also prepared images that will be used for the final website result and placed a placeholder name for the fourth paragrpah of the main website page. I added a `<style>` header to add the following code string I commited for the centered title.
	```<style>
    	h1 {text-align: center;}
    	 <h1>Thinkment: Philosophy and Ideology</h1>
    	</style>```
