  Today, Kajari instructed Celeste and I to have a progress check on our typing accuracy, speed, and the amount of errors I had during typing. Kajari designated us to  the Typing Test website to test out typing. I got an average speed of 47.93 WPM and average accuracy of 98.60% on my first try. After a few games, my overall speed and accuracy became 40.60 WPM and 92.08%. Overtime, our average speed and accuracy will improve as its essential for coders to type a high speed to coplete there work faster.
