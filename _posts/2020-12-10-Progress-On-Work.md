Today, We had slight delay in starting work, so Kajari gave us the task on working on Typing Club while we awaited for the Macbooks. Once we had our Macbooks dropped off, I continued working on my website based on the design I want. I finalized a name for the website, being Thinkment: Philosophy and Ideology, but have yet to fully finish writing the coding script for it to pop up. I wrote three paragraphs that are based on the website's outcome, what the website will represent and show. I used the `<p>` and `</p>` script to write the paragraphs in, but would need to update them with more text, in-depth analogy, and fixed the script up. THe text was much longer, but I kept updating it to make it simpler for audiences who have little to knowledge and avoid promoting propaganda.
