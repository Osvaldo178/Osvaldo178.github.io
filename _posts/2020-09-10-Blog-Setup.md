  Today, I was finally able to set up my first blog post with the aid of Kajari. Having a blog is essential for your coworkers to keep track and learn of the work you accomplish as an intern. It also helps for yourself to look at past work done when having  Kajari provided the tools needed to set up a blog, despite the issues encountered with chromebooks. The issues I encountered were dragging the web theme files onto Github, as the Chromebooks donâ€™t allow unzip files to be dragged on. Another issue I encountered was my chromebook freezing everytime I tried to drag files onto Github, making it difficult to complete the task. The chromebooks had school restrictions that disabled any applications for doing to be installed.
