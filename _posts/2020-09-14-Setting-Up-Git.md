Today, Kajari helped us finalize seeting up git through the terminal. We used 
*git clone- The ‘git clone’ command allows the user to 
*git pull- The ‘git pull’ command allows the user to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content
*git status- The ‘git status’ command allows the user to display the state of the working working directory at the application it's being run on.
*git commit- The ‘git commit’ command allows the user to commit and individual change to a file
*git push- The ‘Git Push’ command allows the user to upload local repository work onto remote repository
