Today, we began work with continuing our progress on Typing Club. After, we sent Kajari the results and she gave us a new task. The task revolves around a youtube video based on coding 7 different games to help us understand more of the variety of games to code. [Here is the video we are currently using for the tasks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNdUVh3qCc) The video gives explanations and goes step by step on certain coding elements in order for the specific game to function. The first game we worked on is the Memory Game. I created a new folder titled Memory_Game, and added the specific files to commit the game to work. I than created an Images folder for the game and added the images provided to us by the instructor of the video. I added the html page layout and began copying the instructor's code. The instructor would teach us of what certain elements do, and how the coding functions.

In the Js file, we added an array of cards, two per image, and linked it using other coding for the cards to pop up and function. The cards all have an id, which is used for the code to respond. We set a time in the functions so the card being clinked on doesn't respond quickly. We create a function for flipping the card and checking for a match. We also set up other coding within those functions for the game to respond.

After adding the code, we created a new repository for the game, pushed it up, and sent it to Kajari for the approval. [Here is the final product of the Memory Game](https://osvaldo178.github.io/Memory_Game/)
