Hello, my name is Osvaldo Escobar and it's my third year as a part time intern at Cape Analytics. As an intern, I’ve experienced working as a data analyst with Feng here, 
getting instructed on working with the Labelbox system. Feng Her would instruct me on reviewing customer books for insurance companies, as a double checking system to 
ensure the custom A.I managed to apply the right work on customer books.  
  I’ve also experienced working in the coding field with former Cape worker, Michael Chen, being taught the fundamentals of coding and how to program basic coding. 
He instructed me on coding basics that act as math problems, being able to understand the concepts needed to overcome obstacles in writing code in Python. 
  During summer break, I went out with family to locations that intrigued feeling loneliness at home. My family and I would visit nature parks and seaside beaches to 
avoid the summer heat and enjoy some time outside with nature. Of course, all of the traveling would be done safely following social distancing guidelines. For this year,
I’m looking forward to understanding coding more at a bigger level, especially as I would be instructed on web design with supervisor, Kajari Ghosh.
