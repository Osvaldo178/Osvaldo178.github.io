  Chromebooks have a very limited system for web design. The problem I encountered was file dragging from a folder related to web theme needed for Github. The chromebooks don'tallow zip files, and in turn, a different technique to unzip files is approached. It also doesn't allow files to be dragged upon Github to install the web theme. Compared to a Linux machine in the long run, Chromebooks won't be useful when doing coding or file work for your web design in Github
