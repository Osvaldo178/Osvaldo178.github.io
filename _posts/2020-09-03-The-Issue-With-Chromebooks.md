  Chromebooks have a very limited system for web design. The Problem I encountered was file dragging from a folder related to a web theme, needed for Github. The chromebooks allow zip files, but the problem was it did not allow dragging the file towards Github. In turn of the problem, a different technique to unzip files is approached. It also doesn't allow files to be dragged upon Github to install the web theme. Compared to a Linux machine in the long run, Chromebooks won’t be useful when doing coding or file related work for your web design in Github. My chromebook screen constantly froze when dragging files, making it irritating to continue the process of dragging files onto Github. The school’s restrictions made it difficult to install the Termax application, halting our work for a while.
