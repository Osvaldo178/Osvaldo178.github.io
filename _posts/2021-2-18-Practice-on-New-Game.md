Today, I continued my progress on typing club for an hour, and after the task, I sent Kajari the results. After, we were instructed to create new folder and html layout for a new game to practice. [This is the article that I used for the practice](https://www.codemahal.com/javascript-and-html5-canvas-game-tutorial-code/). The file was named catch_monsters, and focused on the javascript portion to make the game functional. We were also introduce to adding images onto a folder within the game's folder, as it would implement the pixel images used on the game. 
Completing the practice was a success, and we were instructed on creating a new repository under the name of the game. After some troubles, I was able to create a new repository, and later moved on to create a new pull request as I changed the player speed, game over screen, and time limit. [Here is the completed game with the changes](https://osvaldo178.github.io/catch_monsters/)
