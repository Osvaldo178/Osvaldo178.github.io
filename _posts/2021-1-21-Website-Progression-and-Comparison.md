Today, we started the day of with Typing Club and then move forward to making some changes onto our websites. One Change Kajari instructed us to fix was the amount of blank space that existed in our website. She gave us the following code string to apply those changes:

```<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img ...></td>
        <td>text</td>
    </tr>
</table>```

From there, we were told that any new change on our website must be approved using a Pull request. A noticeable difference between my current website and the sketch I made in November is the layout. I originally planned the website to have a UI with a search bar and sections of the site to visit. The problem is this isn't currently possible as I'm still learning the basics of Html. I'm going to remove the UI knowing the possible loads of coding it has to be achievable, and I feel that isn't possible with my current knowledge. 

Another difference is the front page of the site originally needed to have an image of a philosopher and quote, but in the current state its doesn't have it applied. I plan on adding this on my next workday as I feel that is possible with some coding adjustments.
