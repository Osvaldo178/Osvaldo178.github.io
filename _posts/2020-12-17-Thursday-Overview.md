Today, We began work with completing an hour of Typing Club and sent Kajari the stats for today's Typing Club task. It also our last work day of the year. I can reflect on the challenges and learning I faced during my return to Cape Analytics. The coding scripts I learned and the early bascis and steps in creating our websites based on our designs. Today, I added a lot more text on the front page of the site, mainly placing placeholders for being directed to the page based on the specific topic.
