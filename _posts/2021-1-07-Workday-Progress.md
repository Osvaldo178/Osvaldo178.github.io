Today, we began work with completing an hour of Typing Club and sent Kajari the stats for today's Typing Club task. After the first task, we continued working on our websites, and I managed to add some images for each genre for my website. I also changed the font of the text to sans seriff to make it more visible for any viewer on the website. I continued revising the text to be more fitting and appealing to viewers so it doesn't seem complex nor difficult to understand.
