Today, we began work with continuing our progression on Typing Club. After, we sent Kajari the results and she gave us a task of adding two more monsters to the Catch Monsters Game. I initially began the task with figuring out what to change, and I would replace the code and try to duplicate it but failed. Once my co-worker asked Kajari for a hint, I used that hint and code and added it to my code for the game. After, I sent a pull request of the code for Kajari to leave comments on what to add, change, and replace on the code. After modifying the code further, the two monsters spawned and the hero can interact and catch the monsters properly.
