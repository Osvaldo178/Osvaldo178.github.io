Today, we began work with continuing our progression on Typing Club. After, we sent Kajari the results and she gave us a task of adding two more monsters to the Catch Monsters Game. I initially began the task with figuring out what to change, and I will replace code and try to duplicate it by failed. Once my co-worker asked Kajari for a hint, I used that hint and code and added it to my code for the game. After, I sent a pull request of the code for Kajari to leave comments on what to add, change, and replace on the code. Currently, the extra monster doesn't really work, as the Hero would catch a monster, and both monsters move around the game canvas quickly and remain still.
